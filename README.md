# student_alcohol_consumption_analysis
This is a bit of EDA to the student alcohol consumption data base. As a college student who does not consume alcohol, I was very interested in seeing if there was any evidence to suggest if drinking has any influence over grades.

In conjunction with high level EDA, I attempt to create a CNN with TensorFlow to classify if a student is a drinker or not. After using TensorFlow, we run the same test using AutoML and compare the results.
